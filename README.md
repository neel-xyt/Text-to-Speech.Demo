# Text-to-Speech-Demo
This "[Text to Speech](https://neel-xyt.github.io/Text-to_Speech-Demo/)" demo uses the Web Speech API, a browser feature that allows web applications to convert text into speech.

## HTML Layout:
The page has a text box where the user can input text, and a button with a microphone icon to trigger speech.

## JavaScript (SpeechSynthesis API):
The ```speak()``` function retrieves the text from the textarea and uses ```SpeechSynthesisUtterance()``` to create a speech object. It sets parameters like rate, pitch, and volume, and then calls window.```speechSynthesis.speak()``` to read the text aloud.
# code
```
    <script>
        function speak() {
            var text = document.getElementById('text').value;
            var speech = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance();
            speech.text = text;
            speech.rate = 1;  // Adjust rate if needed
            speech.pitch = 1; // Adjust pitch if needed
            speech.volume = 1;
            window.speechSynthesis.speak(speech);
        }
    </script>
```

## Browser Support: 
This works in modern browsers like ```Chrome```, ```Edge```, and ```Firefox```, but not all browsers support the Web Speech API. Most mobile browsers also support it, though compatibility might vary slightly
